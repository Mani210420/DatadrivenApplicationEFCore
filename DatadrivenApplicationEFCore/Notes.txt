Setup of Databse Context

First write the models
Then install EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer, EntityFrameworkCore.Tools
Then add connection string in appsetting.json
After that add DbContext in program.cs

If we want to make any changes in model and then want to see same changes in Db we need to do migration
add-migration<nameOfMigration>
update-database
Thus a local db is created.

Now as we have empty database we can start by adding data to it initially.
We can write a seed method to achieve this.
